      <p class="text-muted">A well stocked library is open to the pupils on all class days. It is also supplied with periodicals and magazines and is a veritable treasure house of reference books and encyclopedias. Each class is given a library period where the students are to read the books and make review of them.
        The reading of books is conducive to the formation of good mind and it is a source of general knowledge.  
        Students of standard VI and above can ask for books from the librarian. For the boys of Prep to Std. V library books will be available from the class teacher.
        Damage to a book or a loss of a book is to be made good by the offender.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider,canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals preepared, and detaileddescriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Acount on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key. </p>

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendence Management System</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Imlemented Online Attendence: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendanceby logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curreculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number/Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attend will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span-just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and trancsparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confedential manner and at reduced costs. </p>
